# myRecipes

I'm a bit of a control freak. When [Delish.com](https://www.delish.com/) changed the Read settings for their [Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supreme recipe](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a52078/crunchwrap-supreme-recipe/) to paid-members only, I knew I had to do something. So I went into Dev Tools, turned off their SUBSCRIBE NOW modal and reversed their page blur, grabbed the recipe, and wrote it down. But what about all my other favorite recipes on random blogs and Pinterest pins, all subject to deletion/unwanted-amendments at a moments notice? I decided I wanted to control those, too. Thus, [dana-recipes.herokuapp.com](https://dana-recipes.herokuapp.com/) was born.

### Tech Stack
Python, Django framework (with REST API coming!) and some HTML/CSS (Bootstrap makes things easy)
